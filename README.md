# HR-Analytics-Employee-Performance
This project focuses on HR Analytics to track and evaluate employee performance and attrition using data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning techniques. The goal is to assess employee productivity, task completion, and other performance metrics while also predicting employee attrition and identifying patterns that contribute to employee turnover. By analyzing both performance and attrition, HR professionals can derive actionable insights to improve workforce management, retention strategies, and overall organizational success.

The analysis involves:
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning and preparing employee data for analysis, ensuring high-quality input for both performance and attrition metrics.

Performance Metrics:

Identifying key performance indicators (KPIs) and evaluating employee performance based on them.

Analyzing metrics like productivity, efficiency, and task completion.

Attrition Analysis:

Identifying factors contributing to employee attrition (e.g., job satisfaction, work environment, tenure).

Analyzing attrition rates and predicting potential employee turnover.

Data Visualization:

Creating visual representations of performance trends, attrition trends, and comparisons between various employee metrics using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Predictive Modeling:

Using machine learning models to predict employee performance and identify top performers.

Applying machine learning techniques to predict employee attrition, identifying employees at risk of leaving the company.

Technologies Used:
Python: For data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.

Matplotlib and Seaborn: For creating visualizations of employee performance and attrition data.

Scikit-learn: For machine learning models, including performance tracking and attrition prediction.
